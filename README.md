## 🔥 News
- **[2026-02-11]** Released leak detection module. Fixed device mismatch bugs and optimized leak detection moudule.
- **[2026-02-09]** LeakAgent code is released! Now supports advanced sensor placement and boundary optimization.
- **[2026-01-20]** Added support for spectral clustering-based network partitioning.

## 📋 Introduction

**LeakAgent** is a comprehensive multi-agent system designed to revolutionize water distribution network (WDN) management. By leveraging the power of Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs), it acts as an intelligent, interactive assistant for hydraulic engineers and researchers.

The system orchestrates a team of specialized agents to execute complex, multi-step tasks across the WDN lifecycle:

- 💧 **Hydraulic Analysis**: Precision simulation of pressure, flow, and head using EPANET.
- 🧩 **Network Partitioning**: Intelligent division of large networks into manageable optimization zones.
- 📡 **Sensor Placement**: Strategic optimization of sensor locations for maximum coverage and resilience.
- 🔍 **Leak Detection & Localization**: Advanced machine learning models to identify and pinpoint leaks in real-time.
- 📊 **Interactive Visualization**: Intuitive web-based interface for topology analysis and result interpretation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS
- **Python**: 3.8–3.11 (Recommended: 3.11)
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended for training), 16GB+ RAM

### Installation & Run

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mutianwei521/leakagent.git
    cd leakagent
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**
    
    LeakAgent requires an OpenAI API Key to power its multi-modal agents.
    
    - Copy the example configuration file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      # On Windows: copy .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open `.env` and add your API keys:
      ```properties
      OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
      SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here  # Optional
      ```

3.  **Start the system**
    ```bash
    ./start.sh   # Linux/Mac
    start.bat    # Windows
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the interface**
    Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
